# R source codes support

## Prerequisites

- [`plot.matrix`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plot.matrix/vignettes/plot.matrix.html) for visualizing a matrix

## About the dataset

In the original MatLab source codes, the dataset to be used is in binary format, which can be fetched from [Yann LeCun's Blog](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). However, taking R's primitive support for parsing csv files into consideration, I decide to use `.csv`s from [Joseph Chet Redmon's Blog](https://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/).
